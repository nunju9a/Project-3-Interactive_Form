Project 3 - Interactive Form

This project takes an html form and makes it interactive with javascript, relying heavily on jQuery. The form first loads focused on the Name field. If a user selects "Other" from the Job Role, a new input field appears for them to type. Color options for the t-shirt are not shown until a specific design is chosen, and colors match each design. The user is not able to select activites that happen during the same time-frame, and a running tally of their total cost is shown. Users are given 3 payment options and only those details show when each option is selected.

There is validation for the Name, Email, and Activities field. There is also validation for the credit car number, zip code, and cvv ONLY if the credit card payment method is selected.The form cannot be submitted until all fields are correctly filled out, and the user will get error messages if anything is not valid.

I am aiming for exceeds in this project. The color drop down menu is hidden until a T-shirt design is chosen. There is 'real-time' validation for e-mail and all credit card fields. There are multiple messages for the credit card number - one if it is left empty, and another requests a valid 13-16 digit number.
